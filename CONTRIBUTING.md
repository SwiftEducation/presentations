## Post an Issue

If you discover an error, please [add an issue](https://github.com/SwiftEducation/presentations/issues) here on GitHub. Feature requests are welcome. However, this is a community effort, so pull requests are preferred.

## Create a Pull Request

Fork the project, check out the develop branch, create a new branch, commit your changes, and then create a pull request. Please submit your pull request to the **develop** branch of this repository.

The **master** branch is for production-ready code and should not contain incomplete features. Development occurs on the **develop** branch. Once your pull request is accepted, it will be merged into **master**.
